# A461 Structured-Evidence Conflict — Public Experimental Archive

Research-data mirror for the A461 experiments on the typed model scorers **kev-4B** and **SecJev-0.8B**.

## Experimental files

- [`data/A461/rounds/`](data/A461/rounds/) — curated copy of all A461-prefixed experiment directories, covering G3–G5, G2 follow-up, M1–M23, and CPU controls.
- [`data/A461/M23/`](data/A461/M23/) — the earlier M23 first release, retained for link stability.
- [`MIGRATION_MANIFEST.json`](MIGRATION_MANIFEST.json) — original paths, full SHA-256 checksums, complete exclusions, and original source commit.
- [`EXCLUSIONS.md`](EXCLUSIONS.md) — why some files are withheld.

**Verified public status:** 1,799 of 2,004 A461 source files are published: 1,794 byte-identical copies and 5 machine-identifier-redacted records. The other 205 files remain excluded: 178 require sanitization/review and 27 are binary or document artifacts without redistribution clearance. Large capture tensors have **not** been published in this repository's Releases. The source private repository and server originals remain unchanged.

**Hidden-state captures:** Very large float16 `.pt` captures are distributed separately when cleared and uploaded, via [GitHub Releases](../../releases). Do not infer their availability from entries in the raw JSONL files.

## Provenance and interpretation

The original experimental repository is private `dddd2024/jev` at commit `03302ef7867606d2cec527ec0aa8a5abdd0257ee`. All copied files are unchanged; per-file SHA-256 digests are recorded in the manifest. The data includes raw model scores and original preregistrations as well as failures and negative controls. Not every causal or deployment-security hypothesis was established; check the individual reports and qualification limits.

No original model checkpoint or weights, unreviewed third-party material, secrets, or private infrastructure details are deliberately published. This repository does not grant rights to third-party models, third-party datasets, or unlicensed code.

## Reproduction

Individual rounds provide original scripts, frozen manifests, JSONL native scores, JSON summaries and available SHA lists. Some scripts reference unavailable original model checkpoints, omitted capture tensors, or withheld execution metadata. Consequently, score-level reanalysis may be possible where frozen inputs are present, but **end-to-end full model re-execution is not guaranteed** from this public copy alone.
